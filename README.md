# Dish Discovery FullStack Application

Dish Discovery was a tutorial project where I improved my skills in **Vanilla JavaScript** and learned to build a **REST API** using **Jakarta EE 10**. The frontend was developed as a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using Vanilla JS, focusing on dynamic content rendering and seamless user interaction without full-page reloads.

On the backend, the Jakarta EE 10 application features **JWT-based authentication** along with several **CRUD operations** to manage recipe data.

Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with **Docker**, working with **images**, **containers**, and using **Docker Compose** for orchestrating the application's services. This project was a key step in strengthening both my frontend and backend development skills, while also introducing me to containerized deployment.
